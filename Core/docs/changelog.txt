Alterations made to the Emulation Core.
------------------------------------------------------

03 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- Restructured and flattened the file layout to make it easier to
	integrate other source ports.
- Removed disassemble.c/h - moved the 'disassemble' function to neopop.c
- Added filename comments to that start of all source files.
- Made 'mute' a common variable.

04 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- Removed the header links between the system and core code. These
	linked sections are now unified in 'neopop.h'

06 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- Internal rendering is now done in 16 bit, not 32. This will improve
performance a great deal. The pixel format is "X4B4G4R4", if that helps!

09 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- I've removed support for CPU halting, to squeeze out a few extra cycles.

10 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- Added better default memory setup to try and fool some of the 'clever'
games into thinking they're running on a real machine.
- Tracked down and fixed why "Metal Slug 2" wasn't making 
it's in-game voices. 

- Added simple emulation of direct EEPROM access. This lets	more games
save their settings correctly. This fixes KOF-R2 making mode as well.

- Changed the way that flash acceses work, 'flash_write' no longer
writes the flash data to the i/o. This task is undertaken by 'flash_commit'.
This was necessary because direct EEPROM access was killing performance.
'flash_commit' is called when rom_unload is called - In the Windows port
this means when unloading, loading a new rom or quiting. 

- Added raster horizontal position emulation, fixes "NeoGeo Cup '98 Plus Color"

15 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- To make the code more compatible with other compilers, i've changed the
bool type, defined in neopop.h, to BOOL - which is a typedef of int. This
has changed nothing in the Windows port, but should fix other compilers.
Also 'true' and 'false' have been replaced with #defined symbols TRUE and FALSE

- A bug has been discovered in 'drawPattern' as the 4th parameter 'mirror'
was given type bool - when it should really be _u16. This applies to
gfx_scanline_colour.c and gfx_scanline_mono.c.

- Another fix applies only the mono core, and the Plot function. The
file itself has a description of the change.

- Minor changes to 'state.c/h' to remove the 'halt' state and replace it
with the storage of 'eepromStatusEnable'. Neither of these values were
likely to have been set, but this new saving is more accurate.

15 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- I've made the horizontal interrupt code be run after every instruction
this makes the timing more accurate and fixes the fading effects of the
'Memories Off Pure' intro.

16 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- I've done a little optimisation work on the graphics core.
- Fixed the bad notes in the sound emulation - one chip does just the
noise channel, the other does tone generation. There is no need for
a stereo/mono option now...
- Fixed bugs in register storing destination, seemed important, but it's
	had little effect on compatiblity so far...
- Fixed V flag emulation of INC/DEC, fixes "Cotton" menus

18 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- I've moved more stuff out of the local header files and into neopop.h
	This includes: RomInfo, RonHeader, state_store, state_restore.
This is all so that no core header files have to be included by the
system specific code - only neopop.h. This will ensure any internal changes
will not affect future versions. In turn this will hopefully allow older
system code to work with a newer core, and vice-versa.
- Removed 'rom.h' file because all of it's components were moved to NeoPop.h
- Added string support for all non-debug system messages.

21 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Fixed "RR (mem)" - It was actually the [REG] version that hadn't been
	changed to use memory accesses - oops!.
- Fixed potential precidence problems in regX and rCodeX by using ()'s
- Added TSET and MULA instructions, untested.

22 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added correct DMA chaining behaviour. If a DMA trigger is assigned to
multiple channels, then the channel with the lowest index must complete it's
transfer before the next one is activated.

22 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Made the code compile with the "GCC v2.95.3-5 (cygwin special)" compiler.

28 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added implementations for most of the comms bios functions using the
new comms system functions. I'm not sure if RTS emulation is
required at the moment. I believe that flow control and handshaking can be
done at a level higher than the NGPC knows about, so to it comms will always
work right on time... but there may be timing issues to resolve...

30 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Fixed "DIV RR,(mem)" in long mode, wrong operand size.

- Added comms. read and write interrupt/dma calls. This has made many more
games allow their link-up options. However, I have been unable to test them
with a real network, so I'm unsure if the frequent link errors that occur
happen to all users...

- Improved 'R32' memory addressing mode. Fixes a crashing bug in "Card Fighters". 

02 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added the undocumented type 0x13 R32 address mode.

04 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Made the code really compile with GCC.

06 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added better emulation of comms system memory at ram[0x50].

07 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Made the direct EEPROM access more secure by requiring an EEPROM
command to be issued before every write. This isn't perfect, but it
should stop "Gals Fighters" from writing all over itself.

################ 0.70 RELEASE ##################

08 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Made flash writes more robust be eliminating a possible logic error.

09 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Extra cycles for addressing modes.
- Optimised and unified timer updates, adjusted the rates now that
  extra cycles have been accounted for. Verified from "Cool Cool Jam" that
  the timing is pretty accurate.

10 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added frameskipping again, not as slow as I originally thought.
