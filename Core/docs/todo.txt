Features to add to the emulation core
------------------------------------------------------


Far Future, or Never
====================
* Perfect the interrupt timings! - remove 'gfx_hack', big speedup!
* Match Z80 clock speed to 1/2 TLCS-900h.
* Count DMA wait state cycles.
* Fix DAC? so the T1 rate hack on Timer 2 isn't required.
	timing issues are quite complex - see "Super Real Mahjong"
* Timers not complete (obscure modes, used?)
* Clock gear (used?), (remember that it affects timers).
* Character over emulation (obscure, used?)
* Optimise register access - precalculate pointers to rCodeB, rCodeW, rCodeL
* Save flash data with save state - for better consistancy
* FLASH erase (needed? what does the block number mean?)
* Correct cycle counts for HLE bios functions (Difficult)
* Support for real bios emulation
* System Power Off (set bit 7 of 0x6F85) - useful?
* System Resume (possible to suspend)
